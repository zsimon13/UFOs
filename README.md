### Filter Table
![filter_table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/178114984-a983de64-c0d1-4d17-8540-fe5b3893641a.png)

The picture above shows available search criteria for the UFO data including:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape of the UFO

### Search Using one Filter
![1_filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/178114924-29ab0ed2-ed01-4906-a9b3-c0915e28460d.png)

When a single filter is applied, the data is limited to entries that match that specific filter. As can be seen in the example above: when a "Date" is selcected, only entries with taht date will populate the table.

### Search Using Multiple Filters

Thew picture above shows how th edata will populate when multiple filters are utilized. The only results that will populate the table will iunclude matches for all filter used. In this case results will match the "Date" and "State" filters.
